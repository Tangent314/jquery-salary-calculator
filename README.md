## Description

Our office needed a way to calculate everyone's annual salary and then break down how much the company has to pay monthly cover every employee's paychecks.

Step One: Acquire every employee's information -
- This was completed by making input fields for each bit of needed information.

Step Two: Calculate the monthly total -
- First I had add each one of their annual salary to the total salary that the company pays annually.
- Secondly, I had to divide the total annual salary by 12 to receive the monthly cost.
- The last step was to place an alert if the monthly salary passed 20,000. This was completed by turning the text red using jquery's css method.

Step Three: Deleting an employee -
- This was completed by using the keyword "this" and the closest and remove methods on the tr element.
